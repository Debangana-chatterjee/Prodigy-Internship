## ðŸ“Š Projects Overview 

### Task-1

**Objective:**
- Analyze global population trends over the years.
- Identify the top 10 most populous countries based on total population across all years.
- Visualize Region and income based distributions.
  

**Key insights include:**

- A steady increase in global population over the years, with significant growth in certain regions.
- The top 10 most populous countries contributing a substantial share of the world's total population.
- The role of economic factors in population distribution, as observed through income-based analysis.


Through data cleaning, handling missing values, and exploratory visualizations, we provided a clearer understanding of how global demographics have evolved.

### Task-2 

**Objective:**


The project aims to perform Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA) and data preprocessing on the Titanic dataset. The goal is to understand, clean, and transform the dataset for further analysis or predictive modeling.


**Key Insights:**

- First-class passengers had a significantly higher survival rate compared to second and third-class passengers.
- Females had a much higher survival rate than males.
- The age distribution is right-skewed, with most passengers in their 20sâ€“30s.
- Higher fares were associated with a higher likelihood of survival.
